# LunaLink AI Chatbot

## Overview
LunaLink is an accessibility-first AI chatbot designed to make digital conversations more inclusive. It enables users to interact not only via text but also through voice and sign language, with built-in multi-language support. The project integrates a Python backend (NLU, OCR, TTS, APIs) with a Next.js frontend (modern UI, accessibility features).

## Features
* **ü§ñ Conversational AI** ‚Äì Engage in natural language conversations with intelligent responses.

* **üéôÔ∏è Active Voice Mode** ‚Äì Real-time voice conversations with mic ON/OFF control and text-to-speech replies.

* **‚úã Sign Language Mode** ‚Äì Live webcam preview, sign recognition, translation to text, and read-aloud support.

* **üåç Multi-Language Support** ‚Äì Communicate in English, Tamil, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, and Chinese (Simplified).

* **üìÑ OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** ‚Äì Extract text from images and PDFs using Tesseract OCR.

* **üìù File Upload & Summarization** ‚Äì Upload documents (images, PDFs) for extraction and summarization.

* **üîç Natural Language Understanding (NLU)** ‚Äì Powered by Rasa, Regex, and sentiment analysis for robust intent recognition.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **Git:** For cloning the repository.
*   **Python 3.9+:** For the backend services.
*   **Node.js (LTS recommended):** For the Next.js frontend.
*   **npm (Node Package Manager):** Usually comes with Node.js.
*   **Tesseract OCR:**
    *   **Installation:** Follow the instructions for your operating system from the official Tesseract GitHub page: [https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html)
    *   **Environment Variable:** Ensure the Tesseract executable is added to your system's PATH environment variable.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GIETHESHV/LunaLink-AI-Chatbot.git
cd LunaLink-AI-Chatbot
```

### 2. Backend Setup (Python)

1.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

2.  **Install Python Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory (`LunaLink Complete/`) and add any necessary environment variables for your backend services (e.g., API keys for Groq, Ollama, etc.). A `.env` file might look like this:
    ```
    GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
    OLLAMA_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
    # Add other environment variables as needed
    ```

4.  **Run the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    The backend server will typically run on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` or `http://localhost:8000`.

### 3. Frontend Setup (Next.js)

1.  **Navigate to the Frontend Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd lunalink
    ```

2.  **Install Node.js Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    *   **Troubleshooting `npm install` ERESOLVE errors:** If you encounter `ERESOLVE` errors related to conflicting peer dependencies (e.g., `react` versions), you can try running the installation with `--force` or `--legacy-peer-deps`. Be aware that `--force` can lead to an unstable dependency tree.
        ```bash
        npm install --force
        # OR
        npm install --legacy-peer-deps
        ```

3.  **Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the `lunalink/` directory and add any necessary environment variables for your frontend (e.g., API endpoint for the backend).
    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
    # Add other environment variables as needed
    ```

4.  **Run the Frontend Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend application will typically run on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
Once both the backend and frontend servers are running:
1.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
2.  You should see the LunaLink chatbot interface.
3.  Type your queries into the input field and press Enter or click the send button.
4.  Use the microphone button for speech input (if configured).
5.  Use the upload button to upload images or PDFs for text extraction and summarization.

## Known Issues / Troubleshooting

*   **`Mic is not defined` error:** This error indicates that the `Mic` component (likely from `lucide-react`) is not correctly imported or recognized in `src/app/dashboard/page.js`. Ensure all necessary icons are imported from `lucide-react`.
*   **`Expected 'from', got 'import'` syntax error:** This suggests a potential issue with how imports are structured in `src/app/dashboard/page.js`, possibly a mixed `export` and `import` syntax or an incorrect destructuring of imports. Review the file for correct JavaScript module syntax.
*   **Text-to-Speech (Speaker Button) Repetition:** The current implementation might be replaying the entire chat history. This needs to be debugged to ensure only the latest response is spoken and that the mute functionality works correctly.
*   **File Upload Functionality:** The file upload button currently extracts text to the clipboard. The goal is to integrate this extracted text into the chatbot's context for summarization or other operations, similar to how ChatGPT or Gemini handle file uploads. This requires further development to pass the extracted text to the backend for processing and then display the results within the chat interface.
